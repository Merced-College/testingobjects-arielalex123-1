# testingObjects

this is an example of a ReadMe file.

1. When printing an object without defining toString(), it shows something like Dog@1b6d3586. This happens because Java uses the default toString() method from the Object class, which returns the class name followed by "@" and the hexadecimal hash code.

2. Without constructors, the fields have Java's default values (null, 0, 0.0). While, with default constructor, we can set safe initial values. Also, with parameterized constructor, we can create objects with specific values from the start.
